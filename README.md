 Here is two neural networks built based on the Iris dataset. 
 
 The first model contains one hidden layer with 8 nodes.
 It also has >95% accuracy.
 
 The second model contains 2 hidden layers with 3 nodes each.
 This one albeit trains well doesn't test well. It has a loss function value of 54.12.....
 
 Feel free to improve on this.
